# GB2RS Hosting on a Packet Node

This script will take a local file `localnews`, split it into readable chunks, and print it to STDOUT.

If you have set up a custom application on Linbpq (see [this excellent guide](https://wiki.oarc.uk/packet:linbpq_custom_applications)), you can point it to this executable and the local news will be displayed to anyone opening the custom application.

The script also writes the date and time to a log file, meaning you can see how often your application is used.
